Pre prerequisites:
open up cmd promp / terminal for linux
`pip install cvs`
`pip install random`
`pip install sys`
`pip install easygui`
`pip install null`
`pip install pymsgbox`

Then clone repository from GitHub and should be ready to run.

Note- First time it runs it creates a results.txt then overwrites with each time code is ran, so if you want to keep your results save a local copy with an alterantive name eg results1.txt. There is a sample_results.txt file in project to show what results should be obtained.
